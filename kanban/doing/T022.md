# T022: Test Coverage Gaps
Created: 2026-01-08

## Problem statement / value driver

Audit identified high-risk areas without test coverage. These are critical paths that mutate game state or form the boundary between domain and presentation.


### Scope - goals

Add test coverage for:
- Command handler (`apply/command_handler.zig`, `apply/event_processor.zig`)
- World lifecycle (`world.zig` - transitions, turn FSM, tick pipeline)
- Query boundary (`query/combat_snapshot.zig` - sync with world state)

### Scope - non-goals

- Exhaustive coverage - focus on high-risk paths identified in audit
- Presentation layer tests
- New harness infrastructure (T020 built that)

## Background

### Relevant documents

- `doc/issues/test_setup.md` - Audit section (line 270+)

### Key files

- `doc/issues/test_coverage_audit.md` - IMPORTANT - READ THIS and revise this document.

- `src/domain/apply/command_handler.zig` - play/cancel/commit workflows
- `src/domain/apply/event_processor.zig` - event emission
- `src/domain/world.zig` - world transitions, cleanup
- `src/domain/query/combat_snapshot.zig` - domain→presentation boundary

### Existing systems, memories, research, design intent

From audit:
> Command stack: No tests exercising play/cancel/commit workflows, pending targets, or event emission. These are high-risk because they mutate game state and route user commands.

> World lifecycle: Card registry has tests, but world transitions (start encounter, turn FSM, tick pipeline) and cleanup paths are untested.

> Domain ↔ presentation query boundary: query/combat_snapshot.zig only has a couple of tiny tests; nothing verifies it stays in sync with world state.

## Changes Required

### 1. Command Handler Tests

- Play workflow: hand card → play created → in pending
- Cancel workflow: play removed → card returned to source
- Commit workflow: plays moved to timeline
- Event emission for each action

### 2. World Lifecycle Tests

- Start encounter: world state initialized correctly
- Turn FSM: phase transitions in correct order
- Tick pipeline: ticks processed, events emitted
- Cleanup: resources freed, no leaks

### 3. Query Snapshot Tests

- Snapshot reflects current world state
- Modifier attachability computed correctly
- Targeting DTOs accurate
- Snapshot updates after world mutations

### Challenges / Tradeoffs / Open Questions

- Some of these may need T019 fixtures or T020 harness
- World lifecycle tests may blur into integration territory
- Decide: unit test with mocks, or wait for T020 harness?

## Tasks / Sequence of Work

### Phase 1: Command Handler Integration Tests (card_flow.zig)

Uses T020 harness since these require World + Encounter + combat state.

1. □ Add `cancelCard` helper to harness
2. □ Test: cancel pool card clone → clone destroyed, cooldown cleared, stamina returned
3. □ Test: cancel hand card → card returned to hand, stamina returned
4. □ Test: commitWithdraw → card removed from timeline, focus cost applied
5. □ Test: commitAdd → modifier added to existing play
6. □ Test: commitStack → modifier stacked on play

### Phase 2: Event Processor Tests (event_processor.zig or integration)

7. □ Test: endTurnCleanup → hand discarded, timeline cleared, events emitted
8. □ Test: shuffleAndDraw → cards drawn, events emitted
9. □ Test: checkCombatTermination → victory/defeat detection

### Phase 3: Combat Snapshot Tests (combat_snapshot.zig)

10. □ Test: buildSnapshot reflects card playability after play
11. □ Test: buildSnapshot tracks play targets correctly
12. □ Test: modifier attachability computed for valid combinations

### Phase 4: World Lifecycle (integration)

13. □ Test: FSM transitions through full turn cycle
14. □ Test: processTick pipeline emits expected events

## Test / Verification Strategy

### success criteria / ACs

- Each identified gap has at least one test covering the happy path
- `just check` passes
- No new skipped tests

### Test locations

| Area | Location | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Command handler | `src/testing/integration/domain/card_flow.zig` | Requires World + Encounter + combat state |
| Event processor | `src/testing/integration/domain/card_flow.zig` | Same - needs full game state |
| Combat snapshot | `src/domain/query/combat_snapshot.zig` (inline) + integration | Simple lookups unit-testable; buildSnapshot needs World |
| World lifecycle | `src/testing/integration/domain/card_flow.zig` | FSM + tick pipeline = integration |

## Quality Concerns / Risks / Potential Future Improvements

- Start with unit tests where possible; escalate to integration if setup too complex
- Document any deferred items for T020

## Progress Log / Notes

- 2026-01-08: Task created from audit in doc/issues/test_setup.md
- Depends on: T019 (fixtures), T020 (harness)
- 2026-01-08: Reviewed audit (`doc/issues/test_coverage_audit.md`), testing conventions memory. Clarified scope: will use T020 harness for command handler, event processor, and snapshot tests since they require full World + Encounter setup. Updated task breakdown into 4 phases with specific test cases.
