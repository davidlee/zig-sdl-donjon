# T017: Condition Display in Combat UI
Created: 2026-01-08

## Problem statement / value driver

Conditions (pain, trauma, blood loss, adrenaline, etc.) need visible representation in the combat UI for both player and opponents. Currently conditions are computed but not displayed.

### Scope - goals

- Player's active conditions visible
- Opponent conditions visible (at least major ones)
- Visual distinction between condition severities
- Adrenaline state visible (surge vs crash)

### Scope - non-goals

- Combat log messages (see T016)
- Detailed penalty breakdowns (maybe tooltip later)

## Background

### Relevant documents

- `doc/trauma_wounds_conditions_ph2.md` (Addendum: Revised Increment 4)
- `doc/presentation-domain-decoupling.md` (future: DTO approach)

### Key files

- `src/presentation/views/chrome.zig` - Player status bars (stamina, focus, blood)
- `src/presentation/views/combat/view.zig` - Main combat view, enemy hover tooltip (empty)
- `src/presentation/views/combat/avatar.zig` - Player/enemy avatar sprites
- `src/domain/query/combat_snapshot.zig` - DTO layer (conditions not yet exposed)

### Existing systems

- Chrome renders player resource bars (stamina, focus, blood) - no conditions
- Combat view has enemy hover rect (currently empty) - good place for detailed view
- Avatar is just sprite rendering - conditions could appear nearby
- `Agent.activeConditions()` iterator yields all conditions (stored + computed)
- `ConditionIterator` respects suppression (e.g., adrenaline surge suppresses pain conditions)

## Design Decisions

### Display locations

1. **Compact view (always visible)**:
   - Player: below resource bars in chrome, or next to avatar
   - Enemies: below avatar sprite (small icons/text)

2. **Expanded view (on hover)**:
   - Enemy hover tooltip: list conditions with severity colors
   - Player: possibly a dedicated status panel

### Condition grouping

Show **worst active condition per category** (avoid clutter):

| Category | Conditions (worst→least) | Color |
|----------|-------------------------|-------|
| Blood | hypovolemic_shock → bleeding_out → lightheaded | Red |
| Pain | agonized → suffering → distracted | Orange |
| Trauma | reeling → trembling → unsteady → dazed | Yellow |
| Adrenaline | adrenaline_surge (green), adrenaline_crash (purple) | Special |
| Engagement | pressured, weapon_bound, unbalanced | Blue |
| Sensory | blinded, deafened | Grey |
| Critical | incapacitated | Red/flashing |

### Visual style options

**Option A: Text chips** (simpler)
- Colored text labels: `[AGONIZED]` `[REELING]`
- Pro: Clear, no art needed
- Con: Takes space

**Option B: Icons** (future)
- Small colored icons with tooltip
- Pro: Compact
- Con: Needs icon assets

**Recommendation**: Start with text chips, leave room for icons later.

## Architecture Note

**Current approach**: Direct domain access (`Agent.activeConditions()`)

**Future approach** (per `doc/presentation-domain-decoupling.md`):
- Add `conditions: []ConditionDTO` to `PlayerStatus` / `EnemyStatus` in CombatSnapshot
- View consumes DTOs only
- Can defer to Stage 1 of decoupling roadmap

For T017, acceptable to use direct access for now, refactor later.

## Changes Required

### 1. Condition display helper

```zig
// src/presentation/views/combat/conditions.zig (new)
pub const ConditionDisplay = struct {
    condition: damage.Condition,
    label: []const u8,
    color: Color,
};

pub fn getDisplayConditions(agent: *const Agent, engagement: ?*const Engagement) []ConditionDisplay {
    // Iterate conditions, pick worst per category, return display list
}
```

### 2. Player conditions in chrome

Extend `StatusBars` or add new component below resource bars.

### 3. Enemy conditions on avatar

Below enemy sprite, show 1-3 condition chips.

### 4. Enemy hover tooltip

Populate the empty hover rect in `view.zig` with condition list.

## Tasks / Sequence of Work

- [ ] Create `conditions.zig` helper (iterate, group, pick worst)
- [ ] Add condition text rendering to enemy hover tooltip
- [ ] Add compact condition display below enemy avatars
- [ ] Add player conditions to chrome (below resource bars)
- [ ] Color scheme for severity/category
- [ ] Test with multiple conditions active

## Test / Verification Strategy

### success criteria / ACs

- [x] Can visually identify when player is `.distracted`, `.trembling`, etc.
- [x] Can see opponent's major conditions
- [x] Adrenaline surge/crash visually distinct
- [ ] Hover over enemy shows full condition list
- [ ] Compact view shows worst condition per category

### user acceptance

Playtest: player understands their impairment state at a glance.

## Design Decisions (Resolved)

1. **Max conditions**: Up to 12, but only worst per category (should be ~6-7 max in practice)
2. **Display**: Condition names only (no numeric pain/trauma values)
3. **Incapacitated**: Big white X over sprite - they dead
4. **Rendering**: New `Renderable.condition_chip` using same TTF font as combat log

## Progress Log / Notes

Stub card. Flesh out after T012 (conditions exist) and alongside UI polish pass.

---

**2026-01-08: Fleshed out design**

- Reviewed existing UI structure (chrome, combat view, avatar)
- Identified display locations (compact + hover expanded)
- Proposed grouping by category, show worst per category
- Noted architectural direction (DTO decoupling) but acceptable to defer
- Ready for implementation
