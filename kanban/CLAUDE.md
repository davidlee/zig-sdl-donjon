to create a new card in the backlog from the template with the next ID in sequence:

`just new-card "description here"`

pull cards from backlog to doing before starting work.

read any design documents referenced in the card immediately.

update the task card as soon as each task / phase is completed.

if a referenced document tracks progress, keep it up to date when marking off task completion. Be very concise, reference the card number e.g. ` - (T123):` for details.

move card to done after completion and user acceptance.
