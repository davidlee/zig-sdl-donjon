# T017: Condition Display in Combat UI
Created: 2026-01-08

## Problem statement / value driver

Conditions (pain, trauma, blood loss, adrenaline, etc.) need visible representation in the combat UI for both player and opponents. Currently conditions are computed but not displayed.

### Scope - goals

- Player's active conditions visible
- Opponent conditions visible (at least major ones)
- Visual distinction between condition severities
- Adrenaline state visible (surge vs crash)

### Scope - non-goals

- Combat log messages (see T016)
- Detailed penalty breakdowns (maybe tooltip later)

## Background

### Relevant documents

- `doc/trauma_wounds_conditions_ph2.md` (Addendum: Revised Increment 4)

### Key files

- `src/presentation/views/combat/avatar.zig` (likely location)
- `src/presentation/views/combat/view.zig`

### Existing systems

Avatar already renders agent state. Conditions could be icons/chips near avatar or health bars.

## Changes Required

TBD - design decisions needed:
- Icon set for conditions?
- Chip/badge style?
- Grouping (pain conditions together, trauma together)?
- Stacking indicator for multiple conditions?

## Tasks / Sequence of Work

- [ ] Design condition display (icons, placement)
- [ ] Iterate conditions from agent
- [ ] Render condition indicators
- [ ] Handle opponent display (may show fewer details)

## Test / Verification Strategy

### success criteria / ACs

- Can visually identify when player is `.distracted`, `.trembling`, etc.
- Can see opponent's major conditions
- Adrenaline surge/crash visually distinct

### user acceptance

Playtest: player understands their impairment state at a glance.

## Progress Log / Notes

Stub card. Flesh out after T012 (conditions exist) and alongside UI polish pass.
