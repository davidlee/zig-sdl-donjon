# T005: Multi-Opponent

**Status**: backlog
**Phase**: 5 of 6 (Timing/Simultaneity/Positioning)
**Design Doc**: `doc/timing_simultaneity_positioning.md`
**Depends on**: T004

## Goal

Attention system; flanking; positioning contests between combatants.

## Tasks

- [ ] 5.1 Add `AttentionState` (primary target, Acuity-based awareness)
- [ ] 5.2 Apply attention penalties to non-primary targets
- [ ] 5.3 Implement `assessFlanking` (none/partial/surrounded)
- [ ] 5.4 Apply flanking effects (defense penalty, hit location shift)
- [ ] 5.5 Implement positioning contests (`resolveManoeuvreConflict`)
- [ ] 5.6 Integrate positioning contests into tick resolution
- [ ] 5.7 Add multi-opponent manoeuvres (circle, disengage, pivot)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Attacking non-primary target has penalty based on awareness
- Acuity improves awareness (finally useful!)
- Flanking detected with 2+ active engagements
- Positioning contests resolve advance vs retreat/sidestep
- Standing still loses positioning contest automatically

## Key Files

```
src/domain/combat.zig        # AttentionState, assessFlanking
src/domain/positioning.zig   # NEW: resolveManoeuvreConflict
src/domain/resolution.zig    # attention/flanking modifiers
src/domain/tick.zig          # contest integration
src/content/cards/manoeuvres.zig  # multi-opponent cards
```

## Positioning Contest Outcomes

| Aggressor | Defender | Contest Type |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Advance | Retreat | Chase (speed vs speed) |
| Advance | Advance | Collision (who gets inside) |
| Advance | Sidestep | Angle (position vs agility) |
| Advance | Nothing | Auto-win (standing still penalty) |

## Multi-Opponent Manoeuvres

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Circle | Improve position vs all; line enemies up |
| Disengage | Open range from all enemies |
| Pivot | Switch primary + position bonus vs one |

## Unlocks

- Viable multi-opponent combat
- Acuity stat relevance
- Tactical depth in positioning
