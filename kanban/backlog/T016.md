# T016: Trauma System Events & Combat Log
Created: 2026-01-08

## Problem statement / value driver

Pain, trauma, adrenaline, and condition changes need to be communicated to the player via the combat log. Without events, these systems are invisible.

### Scope - goals

- Events emitted for pain/trauma accumulation
- Events for condition gain/loss (especially computed conditions)
- Events for adrenaline surge/crash transitions
- Events for incapacitation
- Combat log renders these meaningfully

### Scope - non-goals

- UI display of conditions (see T017)
- Dud card injection feedback (handled by card system)

## Background

### Relevant documents

- `doc/trauma_wounds_conditions_ph2.md` (Addendum: Revised Increment 4)

### Key files

- `src/domain/events.zig`
- Combat log rendering (TBD)

### Existing systems

Existing event types for wounds, blood loss. Follow same patterns.

## Changes Required

TBD - flesh out after T010-T013 complete.

Likely events:
- `pain_increased`, `trauma_increased`
- `condition_gained`, `condition_lost`
- `adrenaline_surge_triggered`, `adrenaline_crash_triggered`
- `agent_incapacitated`

## Tasks / Sequence of Work

- [ ] Identify event emission points in T010-T013 code
- [ ] Define event types
- [ ] Wire emission
- [ ] Combat log formatting

## Test / Verification Strategy

### success criteria / ACs

- Player can see in combat log when they or opponents gain conditions
- Adrenaline surge/crash is narrated
- Incapacitation is clearly communicated

## Progress Log / Notes

Stub card. Flesh out after core trauma implementation (T010-T013).
