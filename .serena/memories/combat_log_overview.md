# Combat Log Overview
- `src/presentation/combat_log.zig` is a pure presentation component that formats domain `Event` values into colored text spans. The log owns a scrollable list of `Entry { spans: []Span }`, each span carrying `text` and an SDL color. Scroll state lives elsewhere (`ViewState`); the log itself just stores entries up to `max_entries` with eviction.
- Formatting is data-driven off the event union: helpers (`formatWoundNarrative`, `formatArmourDeflected`, `formatGapFound`, etc.) produce strings for wound/armour/body events using body tags, conditions, and agent names from the `World`. Technique resolution events summarize attacker/defender, technique id, outcome, chance vs roll; advantage changes show axis deltas; other events (armour hits, artery hits) get themed colors.
- Adding a new narrated event means extending the switch in `format` to convert the `Event` payload into text and color. All domain signals already flow into `events.Event`; the log never calls back into gameplay logic, maintaining clean separation between systems.
