# a game

This is an experimental deck-building dungeon battler written in Zig (0.15.2) with SDL3 bindings.

The game is about simultaneous disclosure, information asymmetry, and ludicrous simulated detail.

There are no health bars; only bone, tissue penetration, and vital organ trauma.

Success in combat is about anticipating your opponent, carefully conserving stamina, probing and exploiting to gain an advantage, and pressing it at the right time (without over-extending) to land a decisive hit.

Everything is a card, drawn at random from your deck; but your inventory is modelled in autistic detail. Gambeson can be layered under chain; munitions plate is nearly impervious, but leaves your joints vulnerable to a rondel dagger.

Think of it as an attempt to answer the question nobody ever asked: what if Dwarf Fortress fell into a teleporter with Slay the Spire and Balatro?
