Done. Changes for "sand in the eyes":

  cards.zig
  - Changed add_condition to take damage.ActiveCondition (includes expiration info)

  apply.zig
  - executeResolvePhaseRules now handles .all_enemies targeting
  - applyResolveEffect handles add_condition - appends to agent.conditions

  events.zig
  - Added damage import
  - Added condition_applied event

  card_list.zig
  - Added t_sand_in_the_eyes: targets all enemies, applies blinded for 1 tick, exhausts
    - Cost: 1 stamina, 0.15 time
    - Tags: skill, debuff
    - Rarity: uncommon
  - Added 1 copy to BeginnerDeck

  Note: The condition system now applies conditions but doesn't yet tick them down or remove expired ones - that would need wiring into the turn/tick cleanup. The blinded condition also doesn't affect combat mechanics yet (hit chance, etc.) - that's future work. But the scaffolding is now in place.
